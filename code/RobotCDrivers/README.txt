-= Note =-
These drivers are for RobotC 2.00 and higher and are part of the
version 2.1 of the 3rd Party RobotC Drivers suite.

What's new in 2.1?
* You can now calibrate light sensors on a per-port basis. It also works with light sensors
  connected to a sensor MUX.
* Added getUID() which returns a unique ID for your NXT based on the Bluetooth address.
  This number is unique for every NXT.
* All tight while loops have been replaced with while (condition) EndTimeSlice(); This gets rid of warnings.

-= API Documentation =-
The complete API documentation can be found in the html folder.
Just point your browser at the index.html file.
